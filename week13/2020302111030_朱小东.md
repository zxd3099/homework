### Chapter $5$ P $12$

#### Solution

Because full $AS$ path information is available from an $AS$ to a destination in $BGP$, so in $BGP$, loops in paths can be detected as follows: If a $BGP$ receives a route that contains its own $AS$ number in the $AS$ path, then using that route would result in a loop.

#### Solution

$C$ could advertise its route to $D$ via its east coast peering point with $C$, in which way, $B$ would hand over $A-to-D$ traffic at its East Coast peering point.


     
### Chapter $5$ P $20$

#### Solution

If $Z$ wants to transit $Y's$ traffic, $Z$ will send route advertisements to $Y$. However, in this case, because $X$ has a peering agreement with $Y$, and $Y$ has a peering agreement with $Z$, if $Z$ advertizes route to $Y$, $Y$ can re-advertize those routes to $X$. Therefore, BGP doesn't allow $Z$ to implement this policy.



### Chapter $5$ P $22$

#### Solution

Often, the time when network management is most needed is in times of stress, when the network may be severely congested and packets are being lost.  

If $SNMP$ runs over $TCP$, $TCP's$ congestion control would cause $SNMP$ to back-off and stop sending messages at precisely the time when the network manager needs to send $SNMP$ messages. 

In a nutshell, the designers of $SNMP$ chose unreliable $UDP$ rather than $TCP$.
